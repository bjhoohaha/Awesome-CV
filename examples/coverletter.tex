\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a year 3 undergrduate software enthusiast in the Computer Science coursework from National University of Singapore. My accumulated experience points from my coursework includes Algorithms \& Data Structure, Object Oriented Programming and Software Engineering Project to name a few. I am intending to become a programming language or parallel computing wizard upon my graduation, and am hoping to have an adventure into greater depths of software engineering in your company.

\lettersection{My experiences}
I have previously interned as a Full Stack Developer Intern at EduDrift Pte Ltd. where I had to work closely with my superior the Engineering Head as well as getting and understanding requirements from the Product Team. Through the experience, I felt that I had gained better software engineering practices working with code that are live and used in the company's platfrom release that was targeted to be released into production. The experience led me to get familiar and become proficient with the Typescript and React framework with some background in Javascript and VueJs. I managed to quickly understand the ropes, and was able to keep on track with the sprints that product team was pushing for the company's landing site as well as the program creation loop after user authentication. Coming to a month or so to the end of my internship, I was entrusted to create a new backend REST Api for the company's ticket booking system. It has equipped me well with backend knowledge working with Typeorm and NestJS framework for interacting with the postgres database.

A few other interesting side projects that I did are mostly assignments for my coursework. One of which is a legal document information retrieval system using tf-idf which I was mostly involved in the preprocessing of queries with nltk and optimizing the performany of query preprocessing with python's multiprocessing module. Another interesting project was a JLite Toy Compiler for ARM, which I had to use a parser generator and implement my own intermediate code generation and register allocation with Java.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
Apart from being a software enthusiast, I also like to do theater and improvisation on the side for fun. Hence, I am part of the theatre group in NUS called NUS Stage, and have been actively involved in productions namely \textit{The Golden Record 2.0}, and \textit{The Disappearing Number} which were put up on UCC Theatre. These experiences challenge me to be confident on stage in front of hundreds of live audience. Other skills I have picked up includes working together with other cast members as ensemble to support the main cast, negotiating and resolving conflicts within ourselves when we have human traffic issues on stage. Hence, these skills have led me to become a confident and good team player that can be put to use when working in a new environment in your company.
